# WebDev - JavaScript - Week 05 - Session 01
## 🧠 Understanding JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Welcome to **Week 05, Session 01** of our Web Development journey!

In tonight’s session, we’ll be focusing on one of the most important data formats used in modern web development — **JSON**.

---

## 🌟 What is JSON?

**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.

It is a lightweight, text-based format used for **storing and transporting data**, especially between a server and a web application.

Even though the name includes “JavaScript,” JSON is **language-independent** — meaning it’s used in nearly every modern programming language: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, Ruby, C#, and more.

---

## 🔍 Why Should You Care?

If you’re building anything with:

- APIs  
- Dynamic websites  
- Mobile apps  
- Web apps  
- or just working with modern JavaScript…

You’re going to encounter **JSON** all the time.

Knowing how to **read**, **write**, and **manipulate** JSON is a **must-have skill** for every web developer.

## 🧱 The Structure of JSON

A JSON file is made up of two main building blocks:

1. **Objects** – key/value pairs (like JavaScript objects)  
2. **Arrays** – ordered lists (like JavaScript arrays)

### ✅ Example 1: A JSON Object

```json
{
  "firstName": "Alice",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "age": 28,
  "isStudent": false
}
```

### ✅ Example 2: A JSON Array

```json
[
  "HTML",
  "CSS",
  "JavaScript",
  "React"
]
```

### ✅ Example 3: A JSON Object Containing an Array

```json
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB"]
}
```

### ✅ Example 4: A JSON Array of Objects

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "completed": false
  },
  {
    "title": "Complete JavaScript homework",
    "completed": true
  }
]
```

## 🔄 JSON vs JavaScript Objects

Although they look similar, **JSON is not the same as a JavaScript object**.

| Feature                  | JavaScript Object          | JSON Format                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Key quotes               | Optional                    | **Required** (double quotes)   |
| Can use single quotes    | Yes                         | **No** (only double quotes)    |
| Can contain functions    | Yes                         | **No**                         |
| Valid in JS              | Yes                         | Needs parsing first            |

## 📦 Real-World Example: API Response

You’ll often receive JSON data from a server or API that looks like this:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "codeMaster99",
    "email": "codemaster@example.com"
  }
}
```

Using JavaScript, you can work with this data inside your web app.

---

## 🛠️ JavaScript and JSON: Key Methods

### `JSON.stringify()`

Converts a JavaScript object **into** a JSON string.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Jane",
  age: 30
};

const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonStr); // Output: {"name":"Jane","age":30}
```

### `JSON.parse()`

Converts a JSON string **into** a JavaScript object.

```js
const jsonStr = '{"name":"Jane","age":30}';
const user = JSON.parse(jsonStr);

console.log(user.name); // Output: Jane
```
